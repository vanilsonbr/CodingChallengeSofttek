[THIS ALGORITH2 IS PROBABILISTIC AND NEED ADJUSTMENTS, IT IS JUST AN IDEA]
ALGORITHM2 (is yet to be develop): an algorithm that compares a set of objects {S1,S2,...,Sn} and displays a number next
    which is the index of similarity of all those objects using a function compare(X,Y), where X and Y are objects.
    In this specific problem, compare() will be a number M which is the diference between all the numbers inside X and Y.
    Example: consider three arrays A = [0,10,5,4] and B = [0,5,null,null] and C = [10,6,2,null]
        compare(A,B) = abs(0-0) + abs(10-5) + (0) + (0) = 5
        compare(A,C) = abs(0-10) + abs(10-6) + abs(5-2) + (0) = 17
     In this case, A and B seems to be most similar than A and C

MACRO STEPS:
    1. reorder the terms in such a way that it forms words in english (considering a english dictionary as source)
        1.1. use the greedy algorithm to find the first matches in every single line of the input matrix
        1.2. reorder all the columns by using ALGORITHM2 and run the greedy algorith again
        1.3. run the abover minor steps until we have all of the lines reach a similarity level acceptable and be considered the right answer
    2. reorder the words in such a way that they respect the english grammar
    3. reorder the words of the second step in such a way that the full sentence has semanthic

THINGS TO BE DONE TILL THE END OF THE CHALLENGE
* check the complexity of the algorithm
* run tests on the algorithm
* document the next steps
