##How to run the code
You can do this 2 ways:

1. copying the code to the browser console and just deleting the last command (process.exit)
2. installing node.js (go it's website and download the LTS version of node.js) and running CMD in this folder using 'node index.js'

##Directions of the working solution
- this solution is not fully working. By now it's only trying to match the some words present in the provided dictionary (see more instructions about it in the file steps.txt)
- the code must be improved to be runned again and again until it finds the most feasible solution, given the dictionary

##What is needed to be done next
- the next steps must be documented. It means that wathever thought that we have for improving this solution must be written in steps.txt, even though the actual code for it.
